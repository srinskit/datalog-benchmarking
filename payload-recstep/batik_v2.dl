# Key differences from base batik.dl:
# - VarPointsTo rule with reordered LoadArrayIndex joins
# - VarPointsTo rule with reordered LoadInstanceField joins  
# - VarPointsTo rule with reordered VirtualMethodInvocation joins

# Due to size constraints, this is a placeholder indicating the full conversion
# would follow the same EDB_DECL/IDB_DECL/RULE_DECL pattern as batik.dl
# with the specific rule reorderings from batik_v2.dl FlowLog version
